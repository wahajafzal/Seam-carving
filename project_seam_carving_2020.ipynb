    "This notebook provides you with a description of the programming project included in the course. We will use the on-line sessions of the 6th week of the course to illustrate and discuss the contents. **The deadline for submision is Monday October 12th at 8 a.m. Your submission should consist of this same notebook where you have added your code and explanations where we have indicated so.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to let you address a problem that has real applications and that requires good algorithms to be solved. We will work on this together during the on-line sessions and you are expected to do the programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will find out there will be opportunities to improve on the algorithms used to solve the problem. We will introduce a technique for doing so called Dynamic Programming in the 7th week for the course and you will get access to a better version (if you have not yourself discovered it before) by the end of the 7th week. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is adapted from an assignment (for Java) from a course on Algorithms at Princeton University [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall20/cos226/assignments/seam/specification.php ]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that is adressed is described in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving ] and this interactive demo illustrates what we want to achieve [https://www.aryan.app/seam-carving/].\n",
    "\n",
    "Some parts of the program are already in the notebook for you to start experimenting and testing your understanding. You are asked to complete the class ```seam_carving```. You need to provide code where we have indicated so. You are of course allowed to introduce auxiliary functions, but your solutions will be tested by calling the functions we expect you to complete. If you need to use other classes we introduced in the course you are allowed to include them in their own code cell. You should not use other library functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The problem\n",
    "Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one  pixel of height (or width) at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *vertical seam* in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottombwith one pixel in each row;\n",
    "a *horizontal seam* is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image. You can check a gradual shrinking of an image by removing vertical seams in [https://www.aryan.app/seam-carving/].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will provide the initial functionality of a class for doing seam carving: functions to calculate vertical and horizontal seams. \n",

    "### Notation\n",
    "In image processing, pixel (*x*, *y*) refers to the pixel in column *x* and row *y*, with pixel (0, 0) at the upper-left corner and pixel\n",
    "(*W* - 1, *H* - 1) at the lower-right corner. The coordinates in a 3-by-4 image are\n",

    "| (0,3) | (1,3) | (2,3) |\n",

    "and (0, 0) is at the lower-left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each position in the image matrix there is a color given as three integer numbers between 0 and 255. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "| RGB     | Color |\n",

    "Colors with the same value in all three numbers are grey colors (the extreme cases being black and white).\n",

    "### The Energy of an Image\n",
    "The calculation of seams is based on the importance of pixels. The importance is meassured in the form of *energy*. In this project, you will use the *dual-gradient energy function*, which is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--See <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1276390\">the original Seam Carving paper</a> for a discussion of different energy functions.-->\n",

    "Here you can see an image and the energy of each of the pixels: the image with the energy uses the energy value at each pixel to form a grey color. \n",

    "\n",
    "The energy is high (white) for pixels in the image where there is a rapid color gradient. **The seam-carving technique avoids removing such high-energy pixels.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seam Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to find a vertical seam of minimum total energy.\n",
    "(Finding a horizontal seam is analogous.)\n",
    "This is similar to the classic shortest path problem\n",
    "in an edge-weighted digraph, but there are three important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The weights are on the vertices instead of the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is to find the shortest path from *any* of the *W* pixels in the top row\n",
    "to *any* of the *W* pixels in the bottom row.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The directed graph is acyclic, where there is a downward edge from pixel (*x*, *y*) to pixels (*x* - 1, *y* + 1), (*x*, *y* + 1), and (*x* + 1,*y* + 1), assuming that the coordinates are in the prescribed ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seams cannot wrap around the image (e.g., a vertical seam cannot cross from the leftmost\n",
    "column of the image to the rightmost column).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the energy of a pixel\n",
    "This is what you will need to implement in the auxiliary function ```_calculate_energy```.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the *dual-gradient energy function*: The\n",
    "energy of pixel (x, y) is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sqrt{\\Delta_x^2(x, y) + \\Delta_y^2(x, y)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the square of the *x-*gradient\n",
    "$\\Delta_x^2(x, y) = R_x(x, y)^2 + G_x(x, y)^2 + B_x(x, y)^2$,\n",
    "\n",
    "and where the central differences\n",
    "$R_x(x, y)$,\n",
    "$G_x(x, y)$, and\n",
    "$B_x(x, y)$\n",
    "are the differences in the red, green, and blue components between\n",
    "pixel (*x* + 1, *y*) and pixel (*x* - 1, *y*), respectively.\n",
    "The square of the *y*-gradient\n",
    "$\\Delta_y^2(x, y)$ is defined in an analogous manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle pixels on the borders of the image, calculate energy by\n",
    "defining the leftmost and rightmost columns as adjacent and the topmost and bottommost rows as adjacent. For example, to compute the energy of a pixel (0, *y*) in the leftmost column, use its right neighbor (1, *y*) and its “left” neighbor (*W* - 1, *y*).\n",

    "\n",
    "We used two graphs one “graphx” is used for calculations and results across horizontal side of picture, “graphy” is used for calculation and results across vertical side picture. Every node of both graphs represents or carries weight which is energy of that node, which is basically vertices of graphs. Vertices in each graph will be equal to (w x h) of the picture. Edges are links of every vertices or nodes with next nodes in vertical or horizontal direction. The edges can be get determined if we are moving along horizontal side of picture and h of picture is zero then every node will have 2 edges apart from last node where w is highest, if w is 0 then every node will have 3 edges leaving behind the nodes where h is 0 and at maximum value. Nodes where w is maximum nodes will have no edges. If w and h are not 0 and also not at maximum value then every node will have 3 edges. When moving along vertical side then if w is 0 every node will have 2 edges last node will not have any edge where h is maximum, if h is 0 then every node will have 3 edges but node where w is 0 and maximum will have no nodes. If w and h are not 0 and also not at maximum value every node will have 3 edges, node with maximum h will have no nodes. \n",

    "* Calculating energy of every node.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the energy first we need to find the RGB value of every node. If we want to calculate the energy of node at vertices (1,1) and moving along horizontal side then we will use RGB values of nodes at lower and higher position than (1,1) and apply formula of calculating energy, in this case of (1,1) we will take RGB value of node (2,1) and subtract RGB values of (0,1). If we got no node at lower value in that case the node at highest value will become the previous node and we will treat that node as lower node, in case of node (0,0) higher node will be (1,0) but lower node will be (w,0) w is maximum value of width in our case w will be w-1. We will follow same procedure when we will calculate energy along vertical side of picture. Formula used to calculate energy is: \n",
    "If we consider higher RGB as Rh, Gh and Bh and lower RGB as Rl, Gl and Bl formula will be:\n",

    "### Explain how you implemented the functions that calculate the seams.\n",
    "We implemented the seams by graph as argument i.e graphx and graphy.Graphx contains the conditions for horizontal carving (proceeds from left to right) whereas Graphy contains the condition about vertical carving(proceeds from top to bottom). After that we used a function \"vertices\" which returns the value of indexes of all nodes e.g(00,10,20...), and then we initialized a heap.We have used a for loop that explores all the vertices and checks the condition whether the node from which we are starting is in first column or not , if the condition satisfies then dijsktra will be called and its value will be stored in two variables distTo and pathTo i.e weight of the path and route of the path or adjacent nodes respectively. Then we implemented a for loop on pathTo to explore every adjacent node make it stops on (w-1)for horizontal seam or (h-1)for vertical seam and store in a heap and then by using heappop we got the minimum path and weight from left to right of top to bottom. We stored the values and print them in such manner so that program only give us horizontal positions of vertices when we call sc.show_h_seam() and show vertical positions of vertices when we call sc.show_v_seam() as well as energy values.\n",
